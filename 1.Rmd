## Intro  
* Web 1.0 = linking things throughout internet  
* Web 2.0 = linking things with apps 
* Web 3.0 = turning centralised apps into decentralised protocols   


Decentralized web != blockchains  
Blockchains  
* Systematize economics and law     
* A protocol, not web-based  

## Web 3.0   
* Inclusive set of protocols to provide building blocks for application makers      
* Movement of associated tech and people making the web decentralised, verifiable, and secure      
* Bridge blockchain network/protocol and decentralized web using web browser services to give users access to blockchain via apps/software       
* Make everything verifiable e.g. smart contracts between product and user that are safer, more resilient, and ethical          

Components    
* Trustless infrastructure and interoperability      
* Remove intermediaries  
* Provide users with power and ownership over their data identity, security, and transactions  
* Authentiate links between data and programs    
* Add verifiability  
* Facilitate autonomous transaction processing   
* Integrate strong economic incentives to allow systems to run autonomously into the future     

## Open services    
E.g. ETH/Bitcoin blockchains  
* Open source    
* Forkability  
* Permissionless entry  
* Offer service over time   
* Optimise value   
* Can maintain and scale infrastructure autonomously  
* Bitcoin built on Turing Incomplete language (restricted to bitcoin network)    
* Ethereum built on Solidity  
  
## Ethereum blockchain  
* Ethereum is built on incentivising ever layer of centralised network, from security to economics to applications    
* Ethereum = cryptography security x mathematical proof of blockchain layers x economic game theory of transactions        

### ETH virtual machine    
* SWARM - file/data storage   
* Whisper - secure messaging   

### Smart contract programming languages  
* Solidity, Serpent, LLL    
* Foundation for jurisdiction i.e. proto-jurisdiction      
* Computable law that is native to the web    
* Decentralised web = encoding jurisdiction into web using blockchain systems    

### Running ETH nodes/blocks (ETH clients)     
* Geth   
* ETH    
* Pyethapp    

### Software releases    
* Frontier    
* Homestead    
* Metropolis    
* Serenity      

### dApps

### ETH blockchain architecture

\  

#### dApp -> Decentralised economy (social layer) -> Smart contracts -> Storage and content delivery -> Blockchain      

### DAO    
* Decentralised Autonomous Organisation  
* Invest money and make returns based on crowd-sourced and decentralised decisions from DAO      


## Future avenues  
* What will the web 3.0 browser look like? Single page, wallet, browser extension?
